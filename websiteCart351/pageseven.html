<div class="propText1">My starting topic is a wearable technology which incorporates the users GPS location, temperature, a photocell and a heartbeat sensor to accumulate data of a single person or a multitude of people, depending on how many created. Through the various variables emitted by theses sensors, my project will input that data into generative art via Wi-Fi signals.<br>
My initial idea was to create a sense of communication between users who generate high and low heartbeats, however that proved to contain many inconsistencies. This project gives a visual usage to statistics and data, with the usage of the user data, the various variables outputted will be generated onto a web page in the form of colored lines. The lines will be mapped to the user’s location, color size, curves and other factors will be based and mapped on the web page based on the sensor values.<br>
The project will be important for others as it will demonstrate a visualization of their data, as well as others. Through the colored data, we can see certain aspects of one’s life, why their heartrate went up at this moment, one day it took them five minutes to walk a certain distance, today it took twenty, this data will be visualized onto the web page and certain patterns or outliers may be noted on certain days.<br>
This topic is important for me as I find it interesting to view data, which is usually comprised of statistics, number and bar graphs, through art. Art will be the medium of which data will be viewed, and through this art, we can view where patterns are potentially disrupted throughout our lives.<br>
The relationship I would like to encourage between the users and the space is a relationship between user input, data and art. The point of the work is to collect user data and to submit their data to be viewed by them and others to create a collaborative artwork, which represents different instances in people’s lives. Whether they were in a state of running, high heart rate, cold or walking faster than normal, this data will be viewable for all in a colorful art piece. I would like to create this relationship since humans are a collection of data, patterns and actions we do in our daily lives can be all collected through data.<br> However simply outputting this data in a standard number format can be quite uninteresting. However by creating an artwork with this data, the user may be inclined to want to view it more, to see the patterns or chaos in other peoples data.<br>
Using this data, the user can be able to reflect on their day, as well as others. The data visualizes something that might have happened in the user’s day that may be above normal for their patterns or the patterns of the data. Through the different color codes and variables, the user can infer certain aspects of a person’s life, for example, a user walks to the bus and takes five minutes to get there, however one day it takes two and their heartrate is accelerated or their body temperature is higher. <br>We can infer that the user ran to the bus that morning, as they were presumably late.<br>
The project space is primarily based on collaboration among users. The more user’s input, the more data will be processed, and a larger type of artwork will appear. One user may input a certain amount of data, but the data will not be witnessed as art, but merely colored lines with statistics, as more users input their data, the nicer the artwork that will appear, the lines may assemble and form a concrete pattern. The purpose of the collaboration is to create a visual data structure with meaning, the lines will have meaning to them and through theses lines the viewers can witness certain patterns among each other or within themselves.
